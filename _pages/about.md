## Hello

G'day, 

Currently, I'm working on [Heffron AI](https://www.heffron.ai/ "Heffron AI"). We build conversational Voice AI for voicemail. Time is money, therefore our mission is to help individuals and businesses to turn missed calls into revenue.

In December 2023, I finished my undergraduate degree with First Honours in computer science at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) here in Sydney, Australia. While studying, I was supported by the UNSW [Co-op scholarship](https://www.co-op.unsw.edu.au/). I was extremely fortunate to complete my honors thesis on the topic of blockchain scaling algorithms under the advisory of [Dr Sushmita Ruj](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-sushmita-ruj-0), during which we published my first peer-reviewed paper.

Prior to thesis, I worked with [Dr Jiaojiao Jiang](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-jiaojiao-jiang) on classifying node importance on multiplex networks, during which we proposed a simple yet effective algorithm to capture a node's local and global importance. Our work was accepted for an oral presentation at [Complex Networks 2023](https://complexnetworks.org/).

Outside of university, I've been working as a software engineer in various teams and places.

<!-- ### Why Blockchain?

Early on in my undergraduate studies, I interests leaned more towards machine learning and data science. In 2021, at the height of the NFT bull market, I experience first hand the poor scalability issue of Ethereum by paying $90 gas fee on a $30 NFT ([view tx here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x31fc76f46eee32d9ea8142faf1fe30414c04a5e96744dde8e8e96a8ce99290f5)). Overlooking the hype and the FUD during the bull market, I began learning about the fundamentals of blockchain.

Right before it was time to select my thesis topic, I took a blockchain software course ([COMP6452](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/COMP6452?year=2024)) that completely changed my outlook on the potential impact of blockchain technology. I see blockchain as a tool to democratize global finance participation. -->

On the side, I managed (2019-2023) a high school education publisher [Catch Up With Top Achievers](http://Top-Achievers.com.au "Catch Up With Top Achievers"). Our [study guides](https://www.amazon.com.au/s?k=Tree+Niu+Bee+Pty.Ltd&i=digital-text&dc&ref=a9_asc_1 "Study guides") have been consistently ranking first on Amazon under multiple education categories.
