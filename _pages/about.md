## Hello

G'day, I'm currently a forth-year underduate student at the University of New South Wales, studying Computer Science. I'm broadly interested in Machine Learning and Blockchain Technologies.

<!-- Currently, I'm at Westpac's Data Discovery Lab working on various data intensive banking applications. Previously, I was a NLP engineer at WiseTech Global, focused on Part-of-Speech Tagging. -->

At university, I'm researching under Dr Jiaojiao Jiang on dynamic graph node classification using GNN. Truly ground breaking.

<!-- I'm currently doing network security research at UNSW Cybershield under Prof. Vijay Sivaraman. -->

On the side, I manage a high school education publisher [Catch Up With Top Achievers](http://Top-Achievers.com.au "Catch Up With Top Achievers"). Our [study guides](https://www.amazon.com.au/s?k=Tree+Niu+Bee+Pty.Ltd&i=digital-text&dc&ref=a9_asc_1 "Study guides") have been consistently ranking first on Amazon under multiple education categories.
